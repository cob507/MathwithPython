# Division (Just the remainder)

print (9 % 2)

# ** Means Exponent

# We can also use the exponential symbol to calculate powers less than 1.
# For example, the square root of a number n can be expressed as n^1/2
# and the cube root as n^1/3:

print (8 ** (1/3))

# you can use parentheses to combine mathematical operations into
# more complicated expressions. Python will evaluate the expression
# following the standard PEMDAS rule for the order of
# calculations—parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition,
# and subtraction. Consider the following two expressions—one without
# parentheses and one with:

print (5 + 5 * 5)
print ((5 + 5) * 5)
